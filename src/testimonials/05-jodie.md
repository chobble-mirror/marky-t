"Mark was brilliant, he accommodated use very well. Any song we wanted. I gave him a little play list with all different songs and he made sure he played them, he managed to get us all up dancing with the range of music that he played.

I would like to thank Mark for making my party go smoothly and not having to worry about people not enjoying it. I will definitely use them again."
