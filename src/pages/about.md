meta_title: About Marky T
---

Hi, I'm Mark (aka Marky T), an Essex-based DJ who's been living and breathing music since I was just 9 years old, when I got my first set of disco lights and twin tape deck! What started as entertaining family and friends has grown into a 20-year career crafting unforgettable parties across Essex and beyond.

From the legendary Talk nightclub back in 2003 to residencies at Essex's most iconic venues including Sugar Hut, Liquid Envy, and Eclipse, I've honed my craft in the county's most demanding environments. I've even taken my talents to the airwaves, starting with work experience at Storm Radio with Bruno Brookes and now hosting my own weekly show on Radio Essex!

## What Makes Me Different

I'm not just someone who plays songs—I'm a proper personality DJ who creates a unique experience for every event. Whether it's your wedding day, a corporate do or a milestone birthday, I bring genuine enthusiasm, energy and technical skill to make sure your event stands out.

What truly sets me apart is my ability to read a room, mix music live (no awkward stops between songs!), and create a seamless flow throughout your event. With experience entertaining everyone from A-list celebrities to corporate clients, I understand exactly what to play and when to play it to keep your dance floor packed all night.
