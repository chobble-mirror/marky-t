## Your Perfect Wedding, The Ultimate Party

Planning your wedding? I'm Mark (aka Marky T), an Essex-based wedding DJ with over two decades of experience creating unforgettable celebrations. From iconic Essex venues like Sugar Hut to elegant manor houses across the UK, I've spent years perfecting the art of filling dance floors and creating moments that last a lifetime.

But your wedding deserves more than just someone playing songs—it deserves a dedicated professional who'll ensure your day flows perfectly from ceremony to last dance.

## How We'll Work Together

### 1. Initial Consultation

We'll have a relaxed video call to discuss your vision, musical preferences, and any must-play or must-avoid songs. I'll ask questions you might not have thought about and share ideas based on what's worked brilliantly at other weddings.

### 2. Venue Meeting

About a month before your big day, we'll meet at your venue to walk through the logistics, check out the space, and finalise all the details. It's a chance to get to know each other better and ensures I understand exactly what you're looking for.

### 3. Online Planning Tools

You'll have access to your own online wedding planner where you can build your must-play list, add information about key moments, and keep all your wedding music plans in one place.

### 4. On Your Wedding Day

I'll arrive early for a discreet setup, then be on hand throughout the day to coordinate with photographers, venue staff and other suppliers. When it's time to party, I'll create a seamless flow of music that keeps all ages entertained and the dance floor filled.

## The Secret to a Full Dance Floor

After 20 years DJing in Essex's most demanding venues, I've mastered the art of reading a room and knowing exactly what to play next. I mix tracks live (just like in a nightclub), creating a seamless flow of music without awkward stops or starts.

This approach means once the party starts, the energy never drops—I'll build the atmosphere through the night, playing the right tracks at the right time to keep your dance floor packed until the final song.
