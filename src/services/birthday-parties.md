## Why Choose Me for Your Birthday Party?

### Experience That Matters

From intimate gatherings to milestone celebrations, I've DJ'd hundreds of birthday parties for all ages. My experience at iconic venues like Sugar Hut, Talk, Dukes and many more means I bring nightclub quality sound and professional expertise to your special day.

### Personalised Music Selection

No two parties are the same. I work closely with you to understand your music preferences, must-play tracks, and the atmosphere you want to create. Whether you're looking for chart-toppers, nostalgic classics, or a specific genre, I'll craft the perfect playlist.

### Reading the Room

The mark of a professional DJ isn't just playing songsâ€”it's knowing what to play and when to play it. I pride myself on reading the crowd, adjusting the music to keep everyone engaged, and ensuring your dance floor stays packed all night long.
